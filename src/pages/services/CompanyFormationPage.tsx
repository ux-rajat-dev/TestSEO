  question: 'How long does it take to form a company in the EU?',
  answer: 'Formation times vary by country, typically ranging from 3-5 business days in the Netherlands to 10-15 days in other EU countries. Our expedited services can reduce these timeframes in many jurisdictions.'
}, {
  question: 'What are the minimum capital requirements?',
  answer: 'Capital requirements vary significantly across the EU. Some countries like the Netherlands require as little as €0.01, while others like Germany require €25,000 for a GmbH. Our country selector provides specific information for each jurisdiction.'

  answer: 'No, our digital-first approach allows you to complete the entire process remotely for all EU countries. We handle all local paperwork and filings on your behalf.'
}, {
  question: 'What documents are required?',
  answer: 'Generally, you will need proof of identity (passport/ID), proof of address, and if applicable, corporate documents of the parent company. Specific requirements vary by country and can be viewed in our detailed country guides.'
}, {
  question: 'Can I open a business bank account remotely?',
  answer: 'Yes, we have partnerships with various EU banks that allow for remote account opening. The process and requirements vary by country and banking institution.'
}, {
  question: 'What ongoing compliance requirements will my company have?',

const countryFaqs = {
  netherlands: [{
    question: 'What is the difference between a Legal Entity and a Branch Office?',
    answer: 'A Legal Entity is a separate legal entity with limited liability protection for shareholders, while a Branch Office is an extension of your existing company without separate legal status. Legal Entities offer better liability protection but have more formal requirements.'
  }, {
    question: 'How does the Dutch tax system work for companies?',
    answer: 'The Netherlands has a corporate tax rate of 15% on the first €395,000 of profits and 25.8% on profits exceeding that amount. The country is known for its extensive tax treaty network and favorable holding company regime.'
  }, {
    question: 'What is the UBO register in the Netherlands?',
    answer: 'The UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) register requires all Dutch companies to register individuals who ultimately own or control the company (25% or more ownership/voting rights). This information must be registered with the Chamber of Commerce.'

  }, {
    question: 'How does the German trade tax system work?',
    answer: 'In addition to corporate income tax, German companies are subject to trade tax (Gewerbesteuer), which varies by municipality (typically between 14-17%). This makes the effective corporate tax rate approximately 30-33%.'
  }],
  france: [{
    question: 'What is the difference between SAS and SARL in France?',

  }, {
    question: 'What is the process for obtaining a CIF in Spain?',
    answer: 'The CIF (Código de Identificación Fiscal) is the tax identification number for Spanish companies. It is initially provisional when you form your company and becomes permanent once all formation steps are completed. We handle the entire application process.'
  }, {
    question: 'Are there regional differences in company formation in Spain?',
    answer: 'Yes, Spain has 17 autonomous communities with varying regional regulations. These can affect aspects like regional taxes, grants, and specific business permits. Our service includes guidance on regional specificities based on your chosen location.'
